  <h1>Hw1-Part 1: Wireframing</h1>
  <p> Here are some of the screen mockups for my possible final project HeadHunter. </p>
  <p> Headhunter is an job hunting application inspired by the dating app Tinder. Users will display their skills and interested positions. Then the application will search through the available users and attempt to match you. Then the user will swipe left or right to select or dismiss the other member. If two users have show interest in each other then the application will create a message thread between them so they can converse.</p>
  <p> First you have the login page. It is a simple pair of email and password fields along with two buttons. One is for signing up and the other is to log in.</p>

  <p> Next we have the signup page. It is a email input field along with two password fields to confirm the user's input is correct. Finally there is the submission button at the bottom</p>
  <img src="/img/signup.png">
  <p> Here we have our Profile page a user can provide their name, location and position of interest. Also they can write a blurb, provide a profile picture and list their skills using the tag lines.</p>

  <p> At the top are navigational buttons, inbox will take you to the inbox buttons while matches takes you to the matching page</p>
  <p> This is the matching page. It will display potential matches listing their information. If you are interested in contacting them you swipe to the right else swipe left to dismiss them for another user.</p>
